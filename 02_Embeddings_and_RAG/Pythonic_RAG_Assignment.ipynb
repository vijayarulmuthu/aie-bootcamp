            "Writing a loop in Python can be done in several ways, depending on your specific use case. Here are some common methods for creating loops, along with best practices:\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. Using a `for` loop\n",
            "\n",
            "The `for` loop is often the most straightforward way to iterate over a sequence (like a list, string, or range):\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example: Print each number from 0 to 4\n",
            "for i in range(5):\n",
            "    print(i)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Using a `while` loop\n",
            "\n",
            "A `while` loop is useful when you want to repeat an action until a certain condition is met:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example: Print numbers until a condition is met\n",
            "i = 0\n",
            "while i < 5:\n",
            "    print(i)\n",
            "    i += 1\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### Best Practices\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Choose the Right Type**: Use `for` loops for definite iterations (e.g., iterating over a list), and `while` loops for indefinite iterations (e.g., until a condition changes).\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Limit Loop Complexity**: Keep the logic inside loops simple to maintain readability and performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Avoid Infinite Loops**: Always ensure that your loop has an exit condition, especially with `while` loops, to avoid running indefinitely.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Use `enumerate`**: When you need both the index and value from a list, consider using `enumerate`:\n",
            "\n",
            "    ```python\n",
            "    my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
            "    for index, value in enumerate(my_list):\n",
            "        print(index, value)\n",
            "    ```\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Use List Comprehensions**: For simpler cases where you're generating a new list, consider using list comprehensions, which can be more efficient:\n",
            "\n",
            "    ```python\n",
            "    squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
            "    ```\n",
            "\n",
            "### Summary\n",
            "\n",
            "Ultimately, the best way to write a loop depends on the specific task you're trying to accomplish. Keep it simple, readable, and efficient, and always test your loops to ensure they behave as expected. If you have a particular scenario in mind, feel free to share, and I'd be happy to provide more tailored advice!\n"

Not only did it tell me how to solve the problem, it also figured out that my code had more bugs and how to solve them, too. The last part of the prompt gave suggestions to improve the code in general.Prompt EngineeringFebruary 202554What about multimodal prompting?Prompting for code still uses the same regular large language model. Multimodal prompting is a separate concern, it refers to a technique where you use multiple input formats to guide a large language model, instead of just relying on text. This can include combinations of text, images, audio, code, or even other formats, depending on the model’s capabilities and the task at hand. Best PracticesFinding the right prompt requires tinkering. Language Studio in Vertex AI is a perfect place to play around with your prompts, with the ability to test against the various models.Use the following best practices to become a pro in prompt engineering.Provide examp', ' and behavior.There can be considerable overlap between system, contextual, and role prompting. E.g. a prompt that assigns a role to the system, can also have a context.However, each type of prompt serves a slightly different primary purpose:• System prompt: Defines the model’s fundamental capabilities and overarching purpose.• Contextual prompt: Provides immediate, task-specific information to guide the response. It’s highly specific to the current task or input, which is dynamic.• Role prompt: Frames the model’s output style and voice. It adds a layer of specificity and personality.Prompt EngineeringFebruary 202519Distinguishing between system, contextual, and role prompts provides a framework for designing prompts with clear intent, allowing for flexible combinations and making it easier to analyze how each prompt type influences the language model’s output.Let’s dive into these three different kinds of prompts.System promptingTable 3 contains a system prompt, where I specify additional information on how to return the output. I increased the temperature to get a higher creativity level, and I specified a higher token limit. However, because of my clear instruction on how to return the output the model didn’t return extra text.GoalClassify movie reviews as positive, neutral or negative.Modelgemini-proTemperature1Token Limit5Top-K40Top-P0.8PromptClassify movie reviews as positive, neutral or negative.
